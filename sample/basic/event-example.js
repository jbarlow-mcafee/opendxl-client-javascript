 // from the DXL fabric. Once the callback is registered, the sample sends a
 // set number of Event messages to the fabric and waits for them all to be
 // received by the callback.

// Create the client

// Create and add event listener

  function (event) {

    // the payload from a binary Buffer into a string, decoded using UTF-8
    // character encoding.

// when the connection has been established
